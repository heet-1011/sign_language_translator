## Working
<p align="justify">This project provides one of the solutions to increase the
communication of Deaf and Dumb peoples with the normal
peoples. In this digital era, Mobile application is the best
solution for everyone to use, so by using the capabilities of
Machine Learning and Image processing algorithms available
in TensorFlow Library we make the working mobile
application. In which, user has to capture image as input and
got the output in terms of text and audio. This will ease the
medium for those special peoples and in some cases using
the Frequent Phrases feature of our application, there is no
need of capturing the photos just they need to press single
button.</p>
